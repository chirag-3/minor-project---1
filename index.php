    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <div id="content">
    Food is one of the necessities of humans, and it stands first among all basic needs - food,<br> shelter, and 
clothing. It is important as it nourishes the human body- sustains<br> the very existence of humans. 
However, with the rising population and development of this <br>country, food wastage has risen to a new 
high.
<br>
We have developed a website which will serve as an intermediate<br> between the peopel who want to donate
and the people who face food scarcity. 
<br>
In not just India but all around the world many functions are organised <br>daily on various different occasions.
Like marraiges, birthdays etc.Lots, of food gets<br> wasted in these functions as more food is produced and people
consume less. On our website <br>the people organising the function can register in advance, so that we can go later
and collect <br>food that has not been consumed and distrubute among the needy.
<br>
Other people also who wish to donate food can use our website.
